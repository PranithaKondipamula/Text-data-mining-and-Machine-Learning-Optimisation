# Adobe Support Case Classification and LLM Optimization

## Project Overview

This project develops a sophisticated framework for categorizing and analyzing support cases from Adobe's customer data. It leverages advanced text mining techniques and machine learning optimization to enhance Adobe's customer support capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Support Case Categorization**: Robust system to classify and organize support cases based on problem type, resolution status, and root cause.
- **LLM Refinement**: Machine learning methodologies to fine-tune Large Language Models specifically for Adobe's support context.
- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: MLPClassifier and GridSearchCV for in-depth feature extraction and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Noise Reduction**: Custom solutions to minimize noise and improve overall model accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (for LLM fine-tuning)
- NLTK/SpaCy (for text processing)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
